# RadiusRumble

RadiusRumble is an exciting multiplayer game built with the Godot Engine. In this game, you play as a colored ball navigating a dynamic world filled with smaller balls and other players. Your goal is to consume smaller balls to grow in size and compete with other players. As you consume others, your ball's radius expands, making you an even greater threatâ€”but also a bigger target!


## Features

- Dynamic Gameplay: Absorb smaller balls to grow your radius and dominate the field.
- Player Competition: Challenge other players in a battle of size and strategy.
- Scaling Difficulty: As your ball gets larger, your agility decreases, adding strategic depth.
- Cross platform because of Godot
- Godot-Powered Graphics: Smooth, vibrant visuals and physics-driven mechanics.
